          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>
            Holidaze is a modern accommodation booking platform developed as
            part of Project Exam 2 at Noroff. The purpose of the project was to
            design and build a fully functional front-end application that
            communicates with the official Holidaze API and supports different
            user roles with distinct functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application allows all users to browse and search venues, view
            detailed venue pages, and explore availability through a booking
            calendar. Registered customers can create and manage bookings, while
            venue managers can create, edit, and delete their own venues, as
            well as view bookings associated with their listings.
          </p>
          <p>
            A strong focus was placed on clear user flows, responsive design,
            and scalable architecture. Role-based access, form validation, and
            API-driven state were implemented to ensure a realistic and reliable
            booking experience. Tailwind CSS was used to create a consistent and
            accessible UI that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile
            devices.
